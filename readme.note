Summary of flow: 
User types a city → checkWeather() fetches data → updates card. 
User clicks search button or presses Enter → same flow. 
If input is empty → fetch current location weather. 
On page load → fetch current location weather automatically. 
Weather icon updates dynamically based on main condition. 
Errors (invalid city, fetch failure, or denied location) are handled gracefully.
